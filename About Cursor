### Cursor

1 → I have created a cursor in a function called Pay() to calculate the salaries of the employees and to insert in a Payroll Table.

2 → The cursor collects the each employee_id and employee_type data into cursor.

3 → After the cursor opened it will fetch details  of employee_id,account_no,account_id,bank_name,gross_salary,net_salary into local variables from 

  accountdetails table 

4 → Later the function will calculate’s  and teturns the Gross and Net Salarie’s details according to the employee’s working type(hourly pay or CTC pay).

5 → Later the the details will inserted into the Payroll Table
